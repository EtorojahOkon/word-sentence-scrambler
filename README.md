# word-sentence-scrambler
Do you love word puzzles? 
 This library helps you scramble words and sentences easily using the Fisher-Yates Algorithm
 
 To use, create an instance of the class Scrambler 
 
 eg var a = new Scrambler()
 
 Then call the shuffleSentence() method with your string as parameter
 eg a.shuffleSentence('I am batman")
 
 The library returns the shuffled word or sentence
 
 Kudos
